# Penguin Perils - Split Scenes Build

This build splits scenes into multiple JS files (BootScene.js, TitleScene.js, GameScene.js, EditorScene.js) and ensures correct load order.

Run locally:

python -m http.server 8000

Then open http://localhost:8000

Push to GitHub and the included workflow will publish to gh-pages branch.
